# 💭 Reflection: Game Glitch Investigator

Answer each question in 3 to 5 sentences. Be specific and honest about what actually happened while you worked. This is about your process, not trying to sound perfect.

## 1. What was broken when you started?

- What did the game look like the first time you ran it?
- List at least two concrete bugs you noticed at the start  
  (for example: "the hints were backwards").

**Bug Reproduction Log**

Document at least 3 bugs you found. Add rows as needed.

| Input                                                                | Expected Behavior                                              | Actual Behavior                                                                                                       | Console Output / Error |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Guessed `1` when the secret was later revealed as `65`               | Game should display **"Go HIGHER!"** because 1 is less than 65 | Game repeatedly displayed **"Go LOWER!"**                                                                             | None                   |
| Clicked **New Game** after losing                                    | Game should reset and allow a new round immediately            | Attempts reset, but game still displayed **"Game Over. Start a new game to try again."** and would not accept guesses | None                   |
| Entered `-35`                                                        | Game should reject negative numbers as invalid input           | Game accepted the guess and displayed **"Go LOWER!"**                                                                 | None                   |
| Entered `-100`                                                       | Game should reject numbers outside the valid range             | Game accepted the guess and displayed **"Go LOWER!"**                                                                 | None                   |
| In **Easy** mode, entered a number greater than `20`                 | Game should reject guesses outside the Easy range (1–20)       | Game accepted the guess and processed it normally                                                                     | None                   |
| Attempt counter showed 1 attempt remaining, then guessed `8` and `4` | Attempt counter and game-over condition should stay consistent | Game displayed **"Out of attempts!"** even though the counter suggested there was still an attempt left               | None                   |
